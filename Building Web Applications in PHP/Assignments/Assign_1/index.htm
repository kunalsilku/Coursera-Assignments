	<h2> The Sun </h2>
  <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as light and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth. It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.

The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As such, it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to white than yellow). It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.

In its core the Sun currently fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, converting 4 million tons of matter into energy every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable – but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.

The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times. The Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of solar calendars, one of which is the predominant calendar in use today.</p>

	<h2> The Moon </h2>
  <p>The Moon is a rounded astronomical body that orbits the Earth as its only natural satellite. It has a rocky silicate composition and is of planetary mass but has no significant atmosphere, hydrosphere or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is 0.1654 g, about one-sixth of Earth's. The Moon's average orbital distance from Earth is 384,402 km (238,856 mi) or 1.28 light-seconds. Its gravitational influence produces Earth's tides and slightly lengthens Earth's day.

The Moon's rotation on its own axis is tidally locked to Earth, so the same side always faces the planet. Changes in perspective when the Moon is viewed from Earth make 59% of the total lunar surface visible. Because the Earth is rotating, the Moon's orbital period is defined in two different ways. From the Earth's perspective a full orbit by the Moon takes 27.3 days (the lunar sidereal period). From a fixed external perspective a single orbit takes 29.5 days (the synodic period). The lunar phases follow the synodic period and form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar—tidal locking makes the synodic period the same length as a lunar day. The near side of the Moon is marked by dark volcanic maria ("seas") filling the spaces between bright ancient crustal highlands and impact craters. The lunar surface is quite dull, with a reflectance just slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt. However, it reflects mainly direct sunlight, is contrasted by the relatively dark sky, and has a large apparent size viewed from Earth, making the Moon the brightest celestial object besides the Sun. Its apparent size in Earth's sky is almost the same as that of the Sun, allowing the Moon to cover the Sun nearly completely during a total solar eclipse.

The mean diameter of the Moon is 3474.8 km, about one fourth of Earth's and comparable to the width of Australia. It is considered a planetary-sized moon, is the fifth-largest planet-orbiting satellite in the Solar System, and is by far the largest relative to the size of the planet it orbits. It is larger than any dwarf planet and, among moons with a known density, has the second highest surface gravity and density in the Solar System after Jupiter's satellite Io.

The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothetical Mars-sized body called Theia.

The first human-made object to reach the Moon was the Soviet Union's uncrewed Luna 2 spacecraft in September 1959, which was intentionally crashed onto the lunar surface. This was followed by the first successful soft landing on the Moon by Luna 9 in 1966. The only human lunar missions to date have been those of the United States' NASA Apollo program. The first human orbital mission was Apollo 8 in 1968 and there were six human landings between 1969 and 1972, beginning with Apollo 11 in July of 1969 and ending with the last human mission, Apollo 17 in 1972. These missions returned lunar rocks which have been used to develop a geological understanding of the Moon's origin, internal structure, and the Moon's later history.

Both the Moon's natural prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of phases as seen from Earth have provided cultural references and influences for human societies and cultures throughout history. Such cultural influences can be found in language, calendar systems, art, and mythology.</p>

	<h2> The Stars </h2>
  <p>A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. The observable Universe contains an estimated 1×1024 stars, but most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.

For most of its active life, a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Near the end of its life, a star can also contain degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.

A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. When the stellar core is sufficiently dense, hydrogen becomes steadily converted into helium through nuclear fusion, releasing energy in the process. The remainder of the star's interior carries energy away from the core through a combination of radiative and convective heat transfer processes. The star's internal pressure prevents it from collapsing further under its own gravity. A star with mass greater than 0.4 times the Sun's will expand to become a red giant when the hydrogen fuel in its core is exhausted.[4] In some cases, it will fuse heavier elements at the core or in shells around the core. As the star expands it throws a part of its mass, enriched with those heavier elements, into the interstellar environment, to be recycled later as new stars. Meanwhile, the core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or, if it is sufficiently massive, a black hole.

Binary and multi-star systems consist of two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and generally move around each other in stable orbits. When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can have a significant impact on their evolution. Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.</p>
